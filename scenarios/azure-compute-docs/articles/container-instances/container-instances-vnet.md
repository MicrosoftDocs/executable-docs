# Deploy container instances into an Azure virtual network

[Azure Virtual Network](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) provides secure, private networking for your Azure and on-premises resources. By deploying container groups into an Azure virtual network, your containers can communicate securely with other resources in the virtual network.

This article shows how to use the [az container create][az-container-create] command in the Azure CLI to deploy container groups to either a new virtual network or an existing virtual network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Subnets must be delegated before using a virtual network
> * Before deploying container groups in virtual networks, we suggest checking the limitation first. For networking scenarios and limitations, see [Virtual network scenarios and resources for Azure Container Instances](container-instances-virtual-network-concepts.md).
> * Container group deployment to a virtual network is generally available for Linux and Windows containers, in most regions where Azure Container Instances is available. For details, see [available-regions][available-regions].

Examples in this article are formatted for the Bash shell. If you prefer another shell such as PowerShell or Command Prompt, adjust the line continuation characters accordingly.

## Prerequisites

### Define environment variables

The automated deployment pathway uses the following environment variables and resource names throughout this guide. Users proceeding through the guide manually can use their own variables and names as preferred.

```azurecli-interactive
export RANDOM_ID="$(openssl rand -hex 3)"
export MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="myACIResourceGroup$RANDOM_ID"
export MY_VNET_NAME="aci-vnet"
export MY_SUBNET_NAME="aci-subnet"
export MY_SUBNET_ID="/subscriptions/$(az account show --query id --output tsv)/resourceGroups/$MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/$MY_VNET_NAME/subnets/$MY_SUBNET_NAME"
export MY_APP_CONTAINER_NAME="appcontainer"
export MY_COMM_CHECKER_NAME="commchecker"
export MY_YAML_APP_CONTAINER_NAME="appcontaineryaml"
```

### Create a resource group

You need a resource group to manage all the resources used in the following examples. To create a resource group, use [az group create][az-group-create]:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location eastus
```

A successful operation should produce output similar to the following JSON:

Results:

<!-- expected_similarity=0.5 -->

```json
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myACIResourceGroup123abc",
  "location": "abcdef",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "myACIResourceGroup123",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```

## Deploy to new virtual network

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using subnet IP range /29 to have only 3 IP addresses. we recommend always to go one range above (never below). For example, use subnet IP range /28 so you can have at least 1 or more IP buffer per container group. By doing this, you can avoid containers in stuck, not able to start, restart or even not able to stop states.

To deploy to a new virtual network and have Azure create the network resources for you automatically, specify the following when you execute [az container create][az-container-create]:

* Virtual network name
* Virtual network address prefix in CIDR format
* Subnet name
* Subnet address prefix in CIDR format

The virtual network and subnet address prefixes specify the address spaces for the virtual network and subnet, respectively. These values are represented in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation, for example `10.0.0.0/16`. For more information about working with subnets, see [Add, change, or delete a virtual network subnet](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet).

Once you deploy your first container group with this method, you can deploy to the same subnet by specifying the virtual network and subnet names, or the network profile that Azure automatically creates for you. Because Azure delegates the subnet to Azure Container Instances, you can deploy *only* container groups to the subnet.

### Example

The following [az container create][az-container-create] command specifies settings for a new virtual network and subnet. Provide the name of a resource group that was created in a region where container group deployments in a virtual network are [available](container-instances-region-availability.md). This command deploys the public Microsoft aci-helloworld container that runs a small Node.js webserver serving a static web page. In the next section, you'll deploy a second container group to the same subnet, and test communication between the two container instances.

```azurecli-interactive
az container create \
  --name $MY_APP_CONTAINER_NAME \
  --resource-group $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
  --image mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld \
  --vnet $MY_VNET_NAME \
  --vnet-address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
  --subnet $MY_SUBNET_NAME \
  --subnet-address-prefix 10.0.0.0/24 \
  --os-type Linux \
  --cpu 1.0 \
  --memory 1.5
```

A successful operation should produce output similar to the following JSON:

When you deploy to a new virtual network by using this method, the deployment can take a few minutes while the network resources are created. After the initial deployment, further container group deployments to the same subnet complete more quickly.

## Deploy to existing virtual network

To deploy a container group to an existing virtual network:

1. Create a subnet within your existing virtual network, use an existing subnet in which a container group is already deployed, or use an existing subnet emptied of *all* other resources and configuration. The subnet that you use for container groups can contain only container groups. Before you deploy a container group to a subnet, you must explicitly delegate the subnet before provisioning. Once delegated, the subnet can be used only for container groups. If you attempt to deploy resources other than container groups to a delegated subnet, the operation fails.
1. Deploy a container group with [az container create][az-container-create] and specify one of the following:
   * Virtual network name and subnet name
   * Virtual network resource ID and subnet resource ID, which allows using a virtual network from a different resource group

### Deploy using a YAML file

You can also deploy a container group to an existing virtual network by using a YAML file, a [Resource Manager template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.containerinstance/aci-vnet), or another programmatic method such as with the Python SDK.

For example, when using a YAML file, you can deploy to a virtual network with a subnet delegated to Azure Container Instances. Specify the following properties:

* `ipAddress`: The private IP address settings for the container group.
  * `ports`: The ports to open, if any.
  * `protocol`: The protocol (TCP or UDP) for the opened port.
* `subnetIds`: The resource IDs of the subnets to be deployed to
  * `id`: The resource ID of the subnet
  * `name`: The name of the subnet

This YAML creates a container group in your virtual network. Enter your container group name in the name fields and your subnet ID in the subnet ID field. We use *appcontaineryaml* for the name. If you need to find your subnet ID and no longer have access to previous outputs, you can use the [az container show][az-container-show] command to view it. Look for the `id` field under `subnetIds`.

```YAML
apiVersion: '2021-07-01'
location: eastus
name: appcontaineryaml
properties:
  containers:
  - name: appcontaineryaml
    properties:
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld
      ports:
      - port: 80
        protocol: TCP
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 1.0
          memoryInGB: 1.5
  ipAddress:
    type: Private
    ports:
    - protocol: tcp
      port: '80'
  osType: Linux
  restartPolicy: Always
  subnetIds:
    - id: <subnet_id>
      name: default
tags: null
type: Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups
```

The following Bash command is for the automated deployment pathway.

```bash
echo -e "apiVersion: '2021-07-01'\nlocation: eastus\nname: $MY_YAML_APP_CONTAINER_NAME\nproperties:\n  containers:\n  - name: $MY_YAML_APP_CONTAINER_NAME\n    properties:\n      image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld\n      ports:\n      - port: 80\n        protocol: TCP\n      resources:\n        requests:\n          cpu: 1.0\n          memoryInGB: 1.5\n  ipAddress:\n    type: Private\n    ports:\n    - protocol: tcp\n      port: '80'\n  osType: Linux\n  restartPolicy: Always\n  subnetIds:\n    - id: $MY_SUBNET_ID\n      name: default\ntags: null\ntype: Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups" > container-instances-vnet.yaml
```

Deploy the container group with the [az container create][az-container-create] command, specifying the YAML file name for the `--file` parameter:

```azurecli-interactive
az container create --resource-group $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
  --file container-instances-vnet.yaml \
  --os-type Linux
```

The following Bash command is for the automated deployment pathway.

```bash
rm container-instances-vnet.yaml
```

Once the deployment completes, run the [az container show][az-container-show] command to display its status:

```azurecli-interactive
az container list --resource-group $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --output table
```

The output should resemble the sample below:

Results:

<!-- expected_similarity=0.4  -->

```output
Name              ResourceGroup             Status     Image                                       IP:ports        Network    CPU/Memory       OsType    Location
----------------  ------------------------  ---------  ------------------------------------------  --------------  ---------  ---------------  --------  ----------
appcontainer      myACIResourceGroup123abc  Succeeded  mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld  10.0.0.4:80,80  Private    1.0 core/1.5 gb  Linux     abcdef
appcontaineryaml  myACIResourceGroup123abc  Succeeded  mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld  10.0.0.5:80,80  Private    1.0 core/1.5 gb  Linux     abcdef
```

### Demonstrate communication between container instances

The following example deploys a third container group to the same subnet created previously. Using an Alpine Linux image, it verifies communication between itself and the first container instance.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to rate limiting in effect for pulling public Docker images like the Alpine Linux one used here, you may receive an error in the form:
>
> (RegistryErrorResponse) An error response is received from the docker registry 'index.docker.io'. Please retry later.
> Code: RegistryErrorResponse
> Message: An error response is received from the docker registry 'index.docker.io'. Please retry later.

The following Bash command is for the automated deployment pathway.

```bash
echo -e "Due to rate limiting in effect for pulling public Docker images like the Alpine Linux one used here, you may receive an error in the form:\n\n(RegistryErrorResponse) An error response is received from the docker registry 'index.docker.io'. Please retry later.\nCode: RegistryErrorResponse\nMessage: An error response is received from the docker registry 'index.docker.io'. Please retry later.\n\nIf this occurs, the automated deployment will exit. You can try again or go to the end of the guide to see instructions for cleaning up your resources."
```

First, get the IP address of the first container group you deployed, the *appcontainer*:

```azurecli-interactive
az container show --resource-group $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
  --name $MY_APP_CONTAINER_NAME \
  --query ipAddress.ip --output tsv
```

The output displays the IP address of the container group in the private subnet. For example:

Results:

<!-- expected_similarity=0.5 -->

```output
10.0.0.4
```

Now, set `CONTAINER_GROUP_IP` to the IP you retrieved with the `az container show` command, and execute the following `az container create` command. This second container, *commchecker*, runs an Alpine Linux-based image and executes `wget` against the first container group's private subnet IP address.

```azurecli-interactive
az container create \
  --resource-group $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
  --name $MY_COMM_CHECKER_NAME \
  --image mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld \
  --command-line "wget 10.0.0.4" \
  --restart-policy never \
  --vnet $MY_VNET_NAME \
  --subnet $MY_SUBNET_NAME \
  --os-type Linux \
  --cpu 1.0 \
  --memory 1.5
```

After this second container deployment completes, pull its logs so you can see the output of the `wget` command it executed:

```azurecli-interactive
az container logs --resource-group $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $MY_COMM_CHECKER_NAME
```

If the second container communicated successfully with the first, output is similar to:

```output
Connecting to 10.0.0.4 (10.0.0.4:80)
index.html           100% |*******************************|  1663   0:00:00 ETA
```

The log output should show that `wget` was able to connect and download the index file from the first container using its private IP address on the local subnet. Network traffic between the two container groups remained within the virtual network.

## Clean up resources

If you don't plan to continue using these resources, you can delete them to avoid Azure charges. You can clean up all the resources you used in this guide by deleting the resource group with the [az group delete][az-group-delete] command. Once deleted, **these resources are unrecoverable**.

## Next steps

* To deploy a new virtual network, subnet, network profile, and container group using a Resource Manager template, see [Create an Azure container group with virtual network](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.containerinstance/aci-vnet).

* To deploy Azure Container Instances that can pull images from an Azure Container Registry through a private endpoint, see [Deploy to Azure Container Instances from Azure Container Registry using a managed identity](../container-instances/using-azure-container-registry-mi.md).
