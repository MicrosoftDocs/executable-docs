#Customer intent: As a developer or cluster operator, I want to deploy a highly available PostgreSQL database on AKS so I can see how to run a stateful database workload using the managed Kubernetes service in Azure.

# Deploy a highly available PostgreSQL database on AKS with Azure CLI

In this guide, you deploy a highly available PostgreSQL cluster that spans multiple Azure availability zones on AKS with Azure CLI.

This article walks through the prerequisites for setting up a PostgreSQL cluster on [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][what-is-aks] and provides an overview of the full deployment process and architecture.

[!INCLUDE [open source disclaimer](./includes/open-source-disclaimer.md)]

## Prerequisites

* This guide assumes a basic understanding of [core Kubernetes concepts][core-kubernetes-concepts] and [PostgreSQL][postgresql].
* You need the **Owner** or **User Access Administrator** and the **Contributor** [Azure built-in roles][azure-roles] on a subscription in your Azure account.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

* You also need the following resources installed:

  * [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.56 or later.
  * [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) preview extension][aks-preview].
  * [jq][jq], version 1.5 or later.
  * [kubectl][install-kubectl] version 1.21.0 or later.
  * [Helm][install-helm] version 3.0.0 or later.
  * [openssl][install-openssl] version 3.3.0 or later.
  * [Visual Studio Code][install-vscode] or equivalent.
  * [Krew][install-krew] version 0.4.4 or later.
  * [kubectl CloudNativePG (CNPG) Plugin][cnpg-plugin].

## Deployment process

In this guide, you learn how to:

* Use Azure CLI to create a multi-zone AKS cluster.
* Deploy a highly available PostgreSQL cluster and database using the [CNPG operator][cnpg-plugin].
* Set up monitoring for PostgreSQL using Prometheus and Grafana.
* Deploy a sample dataset to a PostgreSQL database.
* Perform PostgreSQL and AKS cluster upgrades.
* Simulate a cluster interruption and PostgreSQL replica failover.
* Perform backup and restore of a PostgreSQL database.

## Deployment architecture

This diagram illustrates a PostgreSQL cluster setup with one primary replica and two read replicas managed by the [CloudNativePG (CNPG)](https://cloudnative-pg.io/) operator. The architecture provides a highly available PostgreSQL running on an AKS cluster that can withstand a zone outage by failing over across replicas.

Backups are stored on [Azure Blob Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/), providing another way to restore the database in the event of an issue with streaming replication from the primary replica.

> [!NOTE]
> For applications that require data separation at the database level, you can add more databases with postInitSQL commands and similar. It is not currently possible with the CNPG operator to add more databases in a declarative way.
[Learn more](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg) about the CNPG operator.
