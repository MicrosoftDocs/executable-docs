## Step-by-Step Integration Guide
Follow these steps to set up the stack on your AKS cluster with KAITO, with persona-specific notes for configuration and usage.

### Step 1: Create a Resource Group and AKS Cluster
1. Create a resource group and AKS cluster with GPU support. In this step, we create a resource group.

```bash
export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export RESOURCE_GROUP="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
export REGION="candacentral"

az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $REGION
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your AKS Cluster

1. Create an AKS cluster with GPU support. In this step, we declare environment variables for the resource group and AKS cluster names along with a random suffix to ensure uniqueness.

```bash
export AKS_CLUSTER_NAME="myAKSCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
export GPU_VM_SIZE="Standard_NC6"
export NODE_COUNT=1

az aks create -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --node-vm-size $GPU_VM_SIZE --node-count $NODE_COUNT
```

Results:


```JSON
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx",
  "location": "westus2",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "myResourceGroupxxx",
  "properties": {
      "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```

2. Connect to your cluster:

```bash
az aks get-credentials -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME
```

### Step 3: Install KAITO

1. Add the KAITO Helm repository and update it. Then, install KAITO in its namespace (the namespace is "kaito-workspace"):

```bash
export KAITO_WORKSPACE_VERSION="0.4.4"

helm install kaito-workspace  --set clusterName=$AKS_CLUSTER_NAME https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/raw/gh-pages/charts/kaito/workspace-$KAITO_WORKSPACE_VERSION.tgz --namespace kaito-workspace --create-namespace
```

**For Data Scientists/ML Engineers:** After installation, refer to the [KAITO GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito) for examples on deploying AI models using KAITO's custom resources.

### Step 4: Configure Networking with Cilium

1. Install Cilium via Helm:

```bash
helm repo add cilium https://helm.cilium.io/
helm install cilium cilium/cilium --namespace kube-system
```

2. Verify installation:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=cilium
```

**For Security Engineers/DevSecOps:** Configure network policies to restrict traffic between pods, enhancing security. Refer to the [Cilium Network Policy documentation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/) for details.

### Step 5: Add Storage with OpenEBS

1. Install OpenEBS:

```bash
helm repo add openebs https://openebs.github.io/charts
helm install openebs openebs/openebs --namespace openebs --create-namespace
```

2. Set OpenEBS as the default storage class:

```bash
kubectl patch storageclass openebs-hostpath -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
```

**For Platform Engineers:** Ensure OpenEBS is configured for high availability, critical for stateful AI applications like model checkpoints.

### Step 6: Deploy Model Serving with Seldon Core

1. Install Seldon Core:

```bash
helm repo add seldon-charts https://storage.googleapis.com/seldon-charts
helm install seldon-core seldon-charts/seldon-core-operator --namespace seldon-system --create-namespace
```

2. Deploy a sample model with KAITO and Seldon by applying a custom resource definition:

```bash
cat <<EOF > iris-sdep.yaml
apiVersion: machinelearning.seldon.io/v1alpha2
kind: SeldonDeployment
metadata:
  name: sklearn
  namespace: seldon-system
spec:
  name: iris
  predictors:
  - graph:
      children: []
      implementation: SKLEARN_SERVER
      modelUri: gs://seldon-models/v1.12.0-dev/sklearn/iris
      name: classifier
    name: default
    replicas: 1
EOF

# Verify webhook service has endpoints
echo "Verifying webhook service endpoints..."
until kubectl get endpoints seldon-webhook-service -n seldon-system | grep -q ""; do
  echo "Waiting for webhook endpoints..."
  sleep 5
done

# Apply the Seldon deployment
kubectl apply -f iris-sdep.yaml
```

**For Application Developers:** Use Seldon Core for advanced serving features like A/B testing, improving model deployment flexibility. Refer to the [Seldon Core quickstart guide](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/examples/simple.html).

### Step 7: Set Up Observability with Prometheus and Grafana

1. Install Prometheus:

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus --namespace monitoring --create-namespace
```

2. Install Grafana:

```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm install grafana grafana/grafana --namespace monitoring
```

3. Access Grafana and configure Prometheus as a data source.

**For DevOps/SRE Teams:** Set up alerting in Grafana to notify of performance issues, ensuring proactive incident response.

### Step 8: Add Logging with Loki

1. Install Loki:

```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm install loki grafana/loki-stack --namespace monitoring
```

**For IT Operations/Support:** Use Loki for centralized log analysis, speeding up troubleshooting and reducing mean time to resolution.

### Step 9: Orchestrate Workflows with Argo Workflows

1. Install Argo Workflows by creating its namespace and applying the manifest:

```bash
kubectl create ns argo
kubectl apply -n argo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/refs/heads/main/manifests/quick-start-postgres.yaml
```

2. Define a sample AI workflow (for example, a multi-step pipeline from data preparation to inference).

**For Data Scientists/ML Engineers:** Leverage Argo Workflows for automating multi-step AI pipelines, enhancing efficiency.
