# Control cluster access using Conditional Access with AKS-managed Microsoft Entra integration

When you integrate Microsoft Entra ID with your AKS cluster, you can use [Conditional Access][aad-conditional-access] for just-in-time requests to control access to your cluster. This article shows you how to enable Conditional Access on your AKS clusters.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Entra Conditional Access has Microsoft Entra ID P1, P2, or Governance capabilities requiring a Premium P2 SKU. For more on Microsoft Entra ID licenses and SKUs, see [Microsoft Entra ID Governance licensing fundamentals][licensing-fundamentals] and [pricing guide][aad-pricing].

## Before you begin

* See [AKS-managed Microsoft Entra integration](./managed-azure-ad.md) for an overview and setup instructions.

## Use Conditional Access with Microsoft Entra ID and AKS

1. In the Azure portal, go to the **Microsoft Entra ID** page and select **Enterprise applications**.
1. Select **Conditional Access** > **Policies** > **New policy**.
1. Enter a name for the policy, such as *aks-policy*.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users and groups**. Choose the users and groups you want to apply the policy to. In this example, choose the same Microsoft Entra group that has administrator access to your cluster.
1. Under **Cloud apps or actions** > **Include**, select **Select apps**. Search for **Azure Kubernetes Service** and select **Azure Kubernetes Service Microsoft Entra Server**.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Grant access**, **Require device to be marked as compliant**, and **Require all the selected controls**.
1. Confirm your settings, set **Enable policy** to **On**, and then select **Create**.

## Verify your Conditional Access policy has been successfully listed

1. Get the user credentials to access the cluster using the [`az aks get-credentials`][az-aks-get-credentials] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
     az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myManagedCluster
    ```

1. Follow the instructions to sign in.

1. View the nodes in the cluster using the `kubectl get nodes` command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** and select **Enterprise applications** > **Activity** > **Sign-ins**.

1. Under the **Conditional Access** column you should see a status of *Success*. Select the event and then select the **Conditional Access** tab. Your Conditional Access policy will be listed.
