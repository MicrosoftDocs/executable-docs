# Security Vulnerability Analysis Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive security review of the MongoDB cluster deployment instructions on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Percona Operator and External Secrets Operator. Overall, most risks are related to misconfigurations and reliance on external secret management. In particular, several areas require improvement regarding authentication and authorization settings, network security (e.g., non-enforced TLS), input validation, command injection risk in shell helpers, and secret management practices. While no immediate critical code-level injection was found, proper remediation and adherence to best practices are recommended to prevent potential privilege escalation, data leakage, and cloud exposure risks.

## 2. Methodology

The analysis was performed in two main phases:

• Static Code Review:  
– A manual review of the YAML manifests, shell scripts, Helm commands, and embedded Kubernetes objects.  
– Assessment based on configuration best practices (namespace isolation, RBAC, workload identity annotations).  
– Evaluation of inline scripts (e.g., password generation) for command injection and proper use of environment variable substitution.

• Dynamic/Runtime Assessment:  
– Consideration of how the deployment behaves (runtime secret handling, federated credential use, network communication).  
– Review of cloud-specific operations such as creation of federated credentials, key vault secret policies, and external secret polling frequency.  
– Evaluation of network configurations (unencrypted MongoDB connection string and cross-namespace secret accessibility).

## 3. Findings

The following table summarizes the identified vulnerabilities along with their severity, exact locations (where applicable), description, potential impact, and recommended fixes.

| Severity | Location / Context                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Potential Impact                                                                                                 | Recommended Fix / Code Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Critical | MongoDB connection URI in client connection      | The connection string uses “ssl=false”, disabling encrypted communication between clients and the MongoDB service.                                                                                                                                                                                | Sensitive credentials and data transmissions are exposed to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.         | Enforce TLS/SSL by setting ssl=true and ensuring certificates are properly configured. Example: <br>```
mongosh "mongodb://${databaseAdmin}:${databaseAdminPassword}@${AKS_MONGODB_CLUSTER_NAME}-mongos.mongodb.svc.cluster.local/admin?replicaSet=rs0&ssl=true&directConnection=true"
```                                                                                                                  |
| High     | Workload Identity & Service Account Manifest       | The ServiceAccount YAML includes annotations for workload identity (client-id, tenant-id) and creates federated credentials. If misconfigured (e.g., allowing overly broad access or not restricted to the intended namespace), it could allow unauthorized access or abuse of privileges in the cluster.   | Potential privilege escalation and unauthorized access to resources in the AKS cluster and Azure Key Vault.       | Limit the scope of the service account by using minimal RBAC privileges and enforce strict validation on annotations. Additionally, ensure the federated credential subject is tightly scoped.                                                                                                                                |
| High     | Kubernetes RBAC and Secret Storage                 | Kubernetes Secrets are stored base64-encoded and referenced in multiple YAML files. Without proper encryption at rest (e.g., ETCD encryption) or strict RBAC restrictions, there is a risk that unauthorized users could read sensitive data.                                                    | Exposure of credentials (MongoDB admin, backup, cluster users) if an attacker gains read access to secrets.       | Enable encryption at rest for Kubernetes secrets and restrict access via RBAC. Use tools such as Kubernetes Secret Encryption Providers and audit logs to monitor accesses.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Medium   | Shell Function “generateRandomPasswordString”      | The helper function uses /dev/urandom piped to tr and fold. Although the randomness is sufficient, interpolation of environment variables around this function (if uncontrolled) could allow local command injection in other contexts.                                                       | If an attacker controls input or environment variables, it could inject commands that compromise the system.       | Validate or hard-code the allowed character set and ensure that environment variables used in the script (e.g., for names) are sanitized before use.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Medium   | External Commands with Environment Variables       | Many commands depend on environment variables (e.g., ${AKS_MONGODB_NAMESPACE}, ${MY_IDENTITY_NAME_CLIENT_ID}). Misconfiguration or injection in these variables (if not validated earlier) might lead to unintended command execution or resource exposure.                                        | Unintended namespace creation, malicious resource targeting, or command injection if variables contain unsafe input.| Validate and sanitize environment variables prior to use. For example, using regex checks in your shell script before passing these values to kubectl or helm commands.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Medium   | Federated Credential Creation (az identity)        | The federation subject is constructed with a variable reference to the namespace and service account. If manipulated, attackers might elevate privileges by targeting the wrong subject, especially if OIDC endpoints are misconfigured.                                                         | Privilege escalation leading to unauthorized access to Azure resources.                                          | Double-check the correctness of the issuer URL and subject field. Use strict identity policies and consider auditing the federated credential creation process for unusual modifications.                                                                                                                                         |
| Low      | Logging and Secret Disclosure in Shell Scripts     | The documentation shows echoing of environment variables such as $databaseAdmin and $databaseAdminPassword directly on the console output.                                                                                                                                                     | Risk of leaking sensitive information to local logs or process history, especially in shared environments.         | Remove unnecessary echo commands that print secret values. Use secure logging that obfuscates sensitive data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Low      | Backup and Cloud Storage Secrets                   | While backup operations and storage account access are configured via secrets, the lifecycle of these secrets is not discussed and could lead to outdated or leaked credentials if not rotated properly.                                                                                        | Persistent storage credentials might be exploited if not rotated; manual intervention needed for secret rotations.  | Implement automated secret rotation and periodic audits of backup and storage credentials. Ensure that backups themselves are encrypted and access is strictly limited.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Low      | Certificate and TLS Usage in Internal Communications | The YAML mostly does not enforce TLS for internal connections between pods (example: “ssl=false” in the MongoDB connection URI) and does not detail the use of mutual TLS between components such as the External Secrets Operator and Key Vault.                                              | Risk of interception in a compromised cluster network or lateral movement if an attacker gains in-cluster access.    | Enforce TLS between all cluster components (both intra-cluster and external communications). Configure mutual TLS (mTLS) for sensitive operations between operators and API servers where possible.                                                                                                                              |

## 4. Recommendations

Based on the findings above, the following steps are recommended:

1. Secure Communication:  
 • Update the MongoDB connection string to enforce TLS (ssl=true).  
 • Configure certificates and enable mutual TLS for intra-cluster communications.

2. Harden Identity and Access Management:  
 • Restrict ServiceAccount scopes using strict RBAC policies.  
 • Validate and lock down annotations used for workload identities.  
 • Review and minimize federated credential subject claims ensuring they match the intended namespace/service account.

3. Protect Kubernetes Secrets:  
 • Enable encryption at rest for Kubernetes secrets.  
 • Tighten RBAC to limit secret read/write permissions only to required pods/users.  
 • Audit etcd and secret access logs for anomalous behavior.

4. Sanitize Environment Variables and Shell Scripts:  
 • Validate all environment variables (namespaces, registry names, etc.) before use in commands.  
 • Refactor shell helpers to ensure they are protected against command injection by avoiding unsanitized interpolation.  
 • Remove or mask secret outputs in logs/echo commands.

5. Improve Secret Management and Rotation:  
 • Ensure Azure Key Vault access policies are tightly controlled and secrets are rotated periodically.  
 • Monitor the use of External Secrets Operator and the secret sync frequency, ensuring timely updates and minimizing exposure if a secret is compromised.

6. Monitor and Audit Cloud Configurations:  
 • Regularly audit federated credentials, backup policies, and Key Vault permissions.  
 • Enable logging and alerting on unusual configuration changes in the cloud environment.

## 5. Best Practices

To further improve the security posture of the deployment, consider the following general security best practices:

• Adopt the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) for all identities and resources.  
• Enable network segmentation and enforce security policies between namespaces.  
• Implement regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing on both the Kubernetes infrastructure and deployed applications.  
• Use automation for secret rotations and configuration audits.  
• Integrate continuous monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., cloud-native SIEM) to detect abnormal behaviors quickly.  
• Stay up-to-date with security patches for all deployed software components (Kubernetes, Operators, Helm charts).  
• Educate users and administrators on secure configuration and incident response procedures.

------------------------------------------------------------

By addressing the above recommendations and following best practices, the overall security posture of the MongoDB on AKS deployment can be significantly hardened against common vulnerabilities and misconfiguration risks.
