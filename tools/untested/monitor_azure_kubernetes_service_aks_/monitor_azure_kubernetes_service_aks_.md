# Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) control plane metrics (Preview)

In this article, you learn how to monitor the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) control plane using control plane metrics. 

AKS supports a subset of control plane metrics for free through [Azure Monitor platform metrics](./monitor-aks.md#monitoring-data). The control plane metrics (Preview) feature provides more visibility into the availability and performance of critical control plane components, including the API server, ETCD, Scheduler, Autoscaler, and controller manager. The feature is also fully compatible with Prometheus and Grafana. You can use these metrics to maximize overall observability and maintain operational excellence for your AKS cluster.

## Control plane platform metrics

AKS supports some free control plane metrics for monitoring the API server and ETCD. These metrics are automatically collected for all AKS clusters at no cost. You can analyze these metrics through the [metrics explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics) in the Azure portal and create metrics-based alerts.

View the full list of supported [control plane platform metrics](./monitor-aks-reference.md#metrics) for AKS under the "API Server (PREVIEW)" and "ETCD (PREVIEW)" sections.

## Prerequisites and limitations

* The control plane metrics feature (preview) only supports [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview).
* [Private link](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/private-link-security) isn't supported.
* You can only customize the default [`ama-metrics-settings-config-map`](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration#configmaps). All other customizations aren't supported.
* Your AKS cluster must use [managed identity authentication](use-managed-identity.md).

### Install the `aks-preview` extension

[!INCLUDE [preview features callout](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/aks/includes/preview/preview-callout.md)]

* Install or update the `aks-preview` Azure CLI extension using the [`az extension add`](/cli/azure/extension#az-extension-add) or [`az extension update`](/cli/azure/extension#az-extension-update) command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Install the aks-preview extension
    az extension add --name aks-preview
    
    # Update the aks-preview extension
    az extension update --name aks-preview
    ```

### Register the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview` flag

1. Register the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview` feature flag using the [`az feature register`](/cli/azure/feature#az_feature_register) command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview"
    ```

    It takes a few minutes for the status to show *Registered*.

1. Verify the registration status using the [`az feature show`](/cli/azure/feature#az-feature-show) command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview"
    ```

1. When the status reflects *Registered*, refresh the registration of the *Microsoft.ContainerService* resource provider using the [`az provider register`](/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az provider register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService"
    ```

## Enable control plane metrics on your AKS cluster

You can enable control plane metrics with the Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus add-on when creating a new cluster or updating an existing cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike the metrics collected from cluster nodes, control plane metrics are collected by a component that isn't part of the **ama-metrics** add-on. Enabling the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview` feature flag and the managed Prometheus add-on ensures control plane metrics are collected. After you enable metric collection, it can take several minutes for the data to appear in the workspace.

### Enable control plane metrics on a new AKS cluster

* To collect Prometheus metrics from your Kubernetes cluster, see [Enable Prometheus and Grafana for AKS clusters](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana) and follow the steps on the **CLI** tab for an AKS cluster.

### Enable control plane metrics on an existing AKS cluster

* If your cluster already has the Prometheus add-on, update the cluster to ensure it starts collecting control plane metrics using the [`az aks update`](/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
    ```

## Query control plane metrics

Control plane metrics are stored in an Azure Monitor workspace in the cluster's region. You can query the metrics directly from the workspace or through the Azure managed Grafana instance connected to the workspace.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your AKS cluster resource.
2. From the service menu, click on *Monitor*, select **Monitor Settings**.

> [!NOTE]
> AKS provides dashboard templates to help you view and analyze your control plane telemetry data in real time. If you're using Azure managed Grafana to visualize the data, you can import the following dashboards:
>
> * [API server](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20331-kubernetes-api-server/)
> * [ETCD](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20330-kubernetes-etcd/)

## Customize control plane metrics



AKS includes a preconfigured set of metrics to collect and store for each component. `API server` and `etcd` are enabled by default. You can customize this list through the [`ama-settings-configmap`](https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/configmaps/ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml).

The default targets include the following values:

```yaml
controlplane-apiserver = true
controlplane-cluster-autoscaler = false
controlplane-kube-scheduler = false
controlplane-kube-controller-manager = false
controlplane-etcd = true
```

All ConfigMaps should be applied to the `kube-system` namespace for any cluster.

### Customize ingestion profile

For more information about `minimal-ingestion` profile metrics, see [Minimal ingestion profile for control plane metrics in managed Prometheus](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration-minimal#minimal-ingestion-for-default-on-targets).

#### Ingest only minimal metrics from default targets

* Set `default-targets-metrics-keep-list.minimalIngestionProfile="true"`, which ingests only the minimal set of metrics for each of the default targets: `controlplane-apiserver` and `controlplane-etcd`.

#### Ingest all metrics from all targets

1. Download the ConfigMap file [ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/configmaps/ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml) and rename it to `configmap-controlplane.yaml`.
1. Set `minimalingestionprofile = false`.
1. Under `default-scrape-settings-enabled`, verify that the targets you want to scrape are set to `true`. The only targets you can specify are: `controlplane-apiserver`, `controlplane-cluster-autoscaler`, `controlplane-kube-scheduler`, `controlplane-kube-controller-manager`, and `controlplane-etcd`.
1. Apply the ConfigMap using the [`kubectl apply`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#apply) command.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f configmap-controlplane.yaml
    ```

    After you apply the configuration, it takes several minutes for the metrics from the specified targets scraped from the control plane to appear in the Azure Monitor workspace.

#### Ingest a few other metrics in addition to minimal metrics

The `minimal ingestion profile` setting helps reduce the ingestion volume of metrics, as it only collects metrics used by default dashboards, default recording rules, and default alerts are collected.

1. Download the ConfigMap file [ama-metrics-settings-configmap](https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/configmaps/ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml) and rename it to `configmap-controlplane.yaml`.
1. Set `minimalingestionprofile = true`.
1. Under `default-scrape-settings-enabled`, verify that the targets you want to scrape are set to `true`. The only targets you can specify are: `controlplane-apiserver`, `controlplane-cluster-autoscaler`, `controlplane-kube-scheduler`, `controlplane-kube-controller-manager`, and `controlplane-etcd`.
1. Under `default-targets-metrics-keep-list`, specify the list of metrics for the `true` targets. For example:

    ```yaml
    controlplane-apiserver= "apiserver_admission_webhook_admission_duration_seconds| apiserver_longrunning_requests"
    ```

1. Apply the ConfigMap using the [`kubectl apply`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#apply) command.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f configmap-controlplane.yaml
    ```

    After you apply the configuration, it takes several minutes for the metrics from the specified targets scraped from the control plane to appear in the Azure Monitor workspace.

#### Ingest only specific metrics from some targets

1. Download the ConfigMap file [ama-metrics-settings-configmap]((https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/configmaps/ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml) and rename it to `configmap-controlplane.yaml`.
1. Set `minimalingestionprofile = false`.
1. Under `default-scrape-settings-enabled`, verify that the targets you want to scrape are set to `true`. The only targets you can specify here are `controlplane-apiserver`, `controlplane-cluster-autoscaler`, `controlplane-kube-scheduler`,`controlplane-kube-controller-manager`, and `controlplane-etcd`.
1. Under `default-targets-metrics-keep-list`, specify the list of metrics for the `true` targets. For example:

    ```yaml
    controlplane-apiserver= "apiserver_admission_webhook_admission_duration_seconds| apiserver_longrunning_requests"
    ```

1. Apply the ConfigMap using the [`kubectl apply`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#apply) command.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f configmap-controlplane.yaml
    ```

    After you apply the configuration, it takes several minutes for the metrics from the specified targets scraped from the control plane to appear in the Azure Monitor workspace.

## Troubleshoot control plane metrics issues

Make sure the feature flag `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview` is enabled and the `ama-metrics` pods are running.

> [!NOTE]
> The [troubleshooting methods](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-troubleshoot) for Azure managed service Prometheus don't directly translate here, as the components scraping the control plane aren't present in the managed Prometheus add-on.

* **ConfigMap formatting**: Make sure you're using proper formatting in the ConfigMap and that the fields, specifically `default-targets-metrics-keep-list`, `minimal-ingestion-profile`, and `default-scrape-settings-enabled`, are correctly populated with their intended values.
* **Isolate control plane from data plane**: Start by setting some of the [node related metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default) to `true` and verify the metrics are being forwarded to the workspace. This helps determine if the issue is specific to scraping control plane metrics.
* **Events ingested**: Once you apply the changes, you can open metrics explorer from the **Azure Monitor overview** page or from the **Monitoring** section of the selected cluster and check for an increase or decrease in the number of events ingested per minute. It should help you determine if a specific metric is missing or if all metrics are missing.
* **Specific metric isn't exposed**: There are cases where metrics are documented, but aren't exposed from the target and aren't forwarded to the Azure Monitor workspace. In this case, it's necessary to verify other metrics are being forwarded to the workspace.
> [!NOTE]
> If you are looking to collect the apiserver_request_duration_seconds or another bucket metric, you need to specify all the series in the histogram family
>
```yaml
controlplane-apiserver = "apiserver_request_duration_seconds_bucket|apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum|apiserver_request_duration_seconds_count"
```


* **No access to the Azure Monitor workspace**: When you enable the add-on, you might specify an existing workspace that you don't have access to. In that case, it might look like the metrics aren't being collected and forwarded. Make sure that you create a new workspace while enabling the add-on or while creating the cluster.

## Disable control plane metrics on your AKS cluster

You can disable control plane metrics at any time by disabling the managed Prometheus add-on and unregistering the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview` feature flag.

1. Remove the metrics add-on that scrapes Prometheus metrics using the [`az aks update`](/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks update --disable-azure-monitor-metrics --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
    ```

1. Disable scraping of control plane metrics on the AKS cluster by unregistering the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview` feature flag using the [`az feature unregister`](/cli/azure/feature#az-feature-unregister) command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az feature unregister "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview"
    ```

## FAQ

### Can I scrape control plane metrics with self hosted Prometheus?

No, you currently can't scrape control plane metrics with self hosted Prometheus. Self hosted Prometheus can only scrape the single instance depending on the load balancer. The metrics aren't reliable, as there are often multiple replicas of the control plane metrics are only visible through managed Prometheus

### Why isn't the user agent available through the control plane metrics?

[Control plane metrics in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/metrics/) don't have the user agent. The user agent is only available through the control plane logs available in the [diagnostic settings](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings).
