# Set up FQDN filtering feature for Container Network Security in Advanced Container Networking Services

This article shows you how to set up Advanced Container Networking Services with Container Network Security feature in AKS clusters.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
[!INCLUDE [azure-CLI-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

 The minimum version of Azure CLI required for the steps in this article is 2.71.0. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Enable Advanced Container Networking Services

To proceed, you must have an AKS cluster with [Advanced Container Networking Services](./advanced-container-networking-services-overview.md) enabled.

The `az aks create` command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag, `--enable-acns`, creates a new AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features. These features encompass:
* **Container Network Observability:**  Provides insights into your network traffic. To learn more visit [Container Network Observability](./advanced-container-networking-services-overview.md?tabs=cilium#container-network-observability).

* **Container Network Security:** Offers security features like Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) filtering. To learn more visit  [Container Network Security](./advanced-container-networking-services-overview.md?tabs=cilium#container-network-security).

#### [**Cilium**](#tab/cilium)

> [!NOTE]
> Clusters with the Cilium data plane support Container Network Observability and Container Network security starting with Kubernetes version 1.29.
>
> To enable FQDN policies specifically for this demo, set the `--acns-advanced-networkpolicies` parameter to "FQDN". Note that setting it to "L7" will enable both L7 and FQDN filtering. To disable both features, you can follow the instructions provided in [Disable Container Network Security](./advanced-container-networking-services-overview.md?tabs=cilium#disable-container-network-security).

```azurecli-interactive
# Set an environment variable for the AKS cluster name. Make sure to replace the placeholder with your own value.
export CLUSTER_NAME="<aks-cluster-name>"

# Create an AKS cluster
az aks create \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --location eastus \
    --network-plugin azure \
    --network-dataplane cilium \
    --node-count 2 \
    --enable-acns
    --acns-advanced-networkpolicies FQDN
```

#### [**Non-Cilium**](#tab/non-cilium)

> [!NOTE]
> [FQDN filtering](./container-network-security-fqdn-filtering-concepts.md) feature is not available for Non-cilium clusters

### Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing cluster

The [`az aks update`](/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_update) command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag, `--enable-acns`, updates an existing AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features which includes [Container Network Observability](./advanced-container-networking-services-overview.md?tabs=cilium#container-network-observability) and the [Container Network Security](./advanced-container-networking-services-overview.md?tabs=cilium#container-network-security) feature


> [!NOTE]
> Only clusters with the Cilium data plane support Container Network Security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks update \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --enable-acns
    --acns-advanced-networkpolicies FQDN
```

---    

## Get cluster credentials 

Get your cluster credentials using the [`az aks get-credentials`](/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_get_credentials) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

## Test connectivity with a policy

This section demonstrates how to observe a policy being enforced through the Cilium Agent. A DNS request is made to an allowed FQDN and another case where it is blocked.

Create a file named `demo-policy.yaml` and paste the following YAML manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "allow-bing-fqdn"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo-container
  egress:
    - toEndpoints:
      - matchLabels:
          "k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
          "k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
      toPorts:
        - ports:
           - port: "53"
             protocol: ANY
          rules:
            dns:
              - matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
    - toFQDNs:
      - matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
```
Specify the name of your YAML manifest and apply it by using [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply]:
```console
kubectl apply â€“f demo-policy.yaml -n demo
```

### Create a demo pod

Create a `client` pod running Bash:

```bash
kubectl run -it client -n demo --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.43 --labels="app=demo-container" --command -- bash
```

A shell with utilities for testing FQDN should open with the following output:

```output
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
bash-5.0#
```

In a separate window, run the following command to get the node of the running pod.

```bash
kubectl get po -n demo --sort-by="{spec.nodeName}" -o wide
```

The output should look similar to the following example:

```output
NAME     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP              NODE                                NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
client   1/1     Running   0          5m50s   192.168.0.139   aks-nodepool1-22058664-vmss000001   <none>           <none>
```

The pod is running on a node named `aks-nodepool1-22058664-vmss000001`. Obtain the Cilium Agent instance running on that node:

```bash
k get po -n kube-system -o wide --field-selector spec.nodeName="aks-nodepool1-22058664-vmss000001" | grep "cilium"
```

The expected `cilium-s4x24` should be in the output.

```output
cilium-s4x24                          1/1     Running   0          47m   10.224.0.4      aks-nodepool1-22058664-vmss000001   <none>           <none>
```

### Inspect a Cilium Agent

Use the `cilium` CLI to monitor traffic being blocked.

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n kube-system cilium-s4x24 -- sh
```

```output
Defaulted container "cilium-agent" out of: cilium-agent, install-cni-binaries (init), mount-cgroup (init), apply-sysctl-overwrites (init), mount-bpf-fs (init), clean-cilium-state (init), block-wireserver (init)
#
```

Inside this shell, run `cilium monitor -t drop`:

```output
Listening for events on 2 CPUs with 64x4096 of shared memory
Press Ctrl-C to quit
time="2024-10-08T17:48:27Z" level=info msg="Initializing dissection cache..." subsys=monitor
```

### Verify policy

From the first shell, create a request to the allowed FQDN, `*.bing.com`, as specified by the policy. This should succeed and allowed by the agent.

```bash
bash-5.0# ./agnhost connect www.bing.com:80
```

Then create another request to an FQDN expected to be blocked:

```bash
bash-5.0# ./agnhost connect www.example.com:80
```

Cilium Agent blocked the request with the output:

```output
xx drop (Policy denied) flow 0xfddd76f6 to endpoint 0, ifindex 29, file bpf_lxc.c:1274, , identity 48447->world: 192.168.0.149:45830 -> 93.184.215.14:80 tcp SYN
```

## Clean up resources

If you don't plan on using this application, delete the other resources you created in this article using the [`az group delete`](/cli/azure/#az_group_delete) command.

```azurecli-interactive
  az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP
```
