# What is Advanced Container Networking Services?

Advanced Container Networking Services is a suite of services designed to enhance the networking capabilities of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. The suite addresses challenges in modern containerized applications, such as observability, security, and compliance.

With Advanced Container Networking Services, the focus is on delivering a seamless and integrated experience that enables you to maintain robust security postures and gain deep insights into your network traffic and application performance. This ensures that your containerized applications aren't only secure but also meet or exceed your performance and reliability goals, allowing you to confidently manage and scale your infrastructure.

## What is included in Advanced Container Networking Services?

Advanced Container Networking Services contains features split into two pillars:

 - **Observability**: The inaugural feature of the Advanced Container Networking Services suite bringing the power of Hubble’s control plane to both Cilium and non-Cilium Linux data planes. These features aim to provide visibility into networking and performance.

 - **Security**: For clusters using Azure CNI Powered by Cilium, network policies include fully qualified domain name (FQDN) filtering for tackling the complexities of maintaining configuration.

## Container Network Observability
 
Container Network Observability equips you with network related monitoring and diagnostics tools, providing  visibility into your containerized workloads. It unlocks Hubble metrics, Hubble’s command line interface (CLI) and the Hubble user interface (UI) on your AKS clusters providing deep, actionable insights into your containerized workloads allowing you to detect and determine the root causes of network-related issues in AKS. These features ensure that your containerized applications are secure and compliant in order to enable you to confidently manage your infrastructure.

For more information about Container Network Observability, see [What is Container Network Observability?](container-network-observability-concepts.md).

## Container Network Security

Securing your containerized applications is essential in today's dynamic cloud environments. Advanced Container Networking Services provides features to strengthen your cluster's network security.

### FQDN based filtering 

Enhance egress control with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium's DNS-based policies. Simplify configuration by using domain names (FQDNs) instead of managing dynamic IP addresses.
To learn more, see [FQDN Based Filtering Overview](./container-network-security-fqdn-filtering-concepts.md) documentation.

### Layer 7 (L7) policy (Preview)

Gain granular control over application-level traffic. Implement policies based on protocols like HTTP, gRPC and kafka, securing your applications with deep visibility and fine-grained access control. To learn more, see [L7 Policy Overview](./container-network-security-l7-policy-concepts.md) documentation.

## Pricing
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Advanced Container Networking Services is a paid offering. For more information about pricing, see [Advanced Container Networking Services - Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-container-networking-services/).


## Set up Advanced Container Networking Services on your cluster

### Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
[!INCLUDE [azure-CLI-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

* The minimum version of Azure CLI required for the steps in this article is 2.71.0. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Install the `aks-preview` Azure CLI extension

Install or update the Azure CLI preview extension using the [`az extension add`](/cli/azure/extension#az_extension_add) or [`az extension update`](/cli/azure/extension#az_extension_update) command.

The minimum version of the aks-preview Azure CLI extension is `14.0.0b6`

```azurecli-interactive
# Install the aks-preview extension
az extension add --name aks-preview
# Update the extension to make sure you have the latest version installed
az extension update --name aks-preview
```

### Register the `AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview` feature flag

> [!NOTE]
> Container Network Security features only supported on Azure CNI powered by Cilium based clusters.
> 

Register the `AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview` feature flag using the [`az feature register`](/cli/azure/feature#az_feature_register) command.

```azurecli-interactive 
az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview"
```
Verify successful registration using the [`az feature show`](/cli/azure/feature#az_feature_show) command. It takes a few minutes for the registration to complete.

```azurecli-interactive
az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview"
```

### Create a resource group

A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. Create a resource group using the [`az group create`](/cli/azure/group#az_group_create) command.

```azurecli-interactive
# Set environment variables for the resource group name and location. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your own values.
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<resource-group-name>"
export LOCATION="<azure-region>"
# Create a resource group
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```

### Enable and Disable Advanced Container Networking Services in AKS cluster

#### Create an AKS cluster with Advanced Container Networking Services

The `az aks create` command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag, `--enable-acns`, creates a new AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features. These features encompass:
* **Container Network Observability:**  Provides insights into your network traffic. To learn more visit [Container Network Observability](./container-network-observability-concepts.md).

* **Container Network Security:** Offers security features like FQDN filtering. To learn more visit  [Container Network Security](./advanced-container-networking-services-overview.md#container-network-security).

##### [**Cilium**](#tab/cilium)

> [!NOTE]
> Clusters with the Cilium data plane support Container Network Observability and Container Network security starting with Kubernetes version 1.29.
>
> When the `--acns-advanced-networkpolicies` parameter is set to "L7", both L7 and FQDN filtering policies are enabled. If you only want to enable FQDN filtering, set the parameter to "FQDN". To disable both features, you can follow the instructions provided in [Disable Container Network Security](./advanced-container-networking-services-overview.md?tabs=cilium#disable-container-network-security).


```azurecli-interactive
# Set an environment variable for the AKS cluster name. Make sure to replace the placeholder with your own value.
export CLUSTER_NAME="<aks-cluster-name>"

# Create an AKS cluster
az aks create \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --network-plugin azure \
    --network-plugin-mode overlay \
    --network-dataplane cilium \
