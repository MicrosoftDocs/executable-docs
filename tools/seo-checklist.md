# SEO checklist

This checklist is a short reference to the basics of on-page SEO for contributors to the Learn platform. Review this checklist prior to publishing new or updated content once you do your keyword research and establish your user intent.

## URL

The page URL displays on the search engine results page (SERP) and contributes to both rank and relevance. The URL should:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Include the primary keyword.
> * Follow the URL naming convention for your site.
> * Should be 75 characters max using lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
> * Once chosen, it shouldn't be changed as it affects tracking and could send conflicting signals to search engines.

## Meta title

The meta title is displayed on the SERP and browser bar heading. It has the greatest impact on search rank and click-through-rate (CTR). The meta title isn't the same as the H1. The meta title should:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Include the primary keyword.
> * Be written in title case (capitalize every word except for words like a, an, of, the, etc.)
> * Be 30-65 characters in length. (The entire title is the metadata title + the metadata titleSuffix + the suffix "| Microsoft Learn." Some teams use titleSuffix to add the product name. If your team doesn't use titleSuffix then add the product brand name into the metadata title.)
> * Show enough information for users to determine relevance.
> * Describe a specific scenario or benefit.

## Meta description

The meta description is a short block of text (usually one to three sentences) that gives users a preview of what your page is about. It should be a summary that entices users to click. The meta description allows the search engine and user to understand the page content. The meta description should:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Include the primary keyword.
> * Be between 120 and 165 characters including spaces.
> * Describe the specific scenario and/or benefit of the article.
> * Entice users to click through to the page.
> * Include a call-to-action to improve the click-through-rate.

## Main heading (H1)

The H1 is the main heading at the top of the article. H1 is the second most important text string for search rank and relevance. They also help crawlers and copilots make sense of the page content. H1 isn't the same as the meta title. The H1 should:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Include the primary keyword.
> * Be unique and specific (although it's acceptible to copy the meta title).

## Introduction

The introduction is the first paragraph of the article. It should explain what the article is about and show the benefit to the user.  It also helps crawlers and copilots make sense of the page content. The introduction should:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Include the primary keyword in the first or second sentence.
> * Describe what the article is about early in the paragraph.
> * Describe the specific scenario and/or benefit of the article.
> * Be clear and concise.

## Subheadings (H2-H3)

H2s divide the primary sections on a page. Search engines often display H2s as extra links below the meta description. They also help crawlers and copilots make sense of the page content. Subheadings should:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Include secondary keywords.
> * Be descriptive of a section's content.
> * Use a heading hierarchy (H2-H3) without skipping a level.

## Image alt text

Although alt text is primarily an accessibility feature, it can also improve SEO. Alt text can get a page one result in the image carousel, even if your article isn't on page one of the search results otherwise. Alt text should:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Include the primary keyword and/or secondary keywords when possible.
> * Describe the contents of the image clearly and concisely.
> * Be between 40 to 150 characters.
> * Increase accessibility for users.
> * Avoid language like “image of” or "picture of."

## Image filenames

Like alt text, image filenames can get a page one result in the image carousel, even if your article isn't on page one of the search results otherwise. Image filenames should:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Include the primary keyword and/or secondary keywords.
> * Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only.
> * Be a maximum of 80 characters including spaces.
> * Describe the image.

## Search Results Preview
The Learn Authoring Pack for Visual Studio Code now includes a Search Results Preview to help verify your title and description are helpful to users when returned in search results.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Access the Command Palette with **ALT + M**.
> * Select **Search Results Preview**.
