# Quickstart: Create and SSH into a Linux VM using Azure CLI

In this quickstart tutorial, you will learn how to automate the creation of a Linux virtual machine (VM) and perform a non-interactive SSH connection test using Azure CLI. This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions to help you deploy a VM using a valid Ubuntu image (Ubuntu2204) while avoiding common quota issues.

In response to previous errors, the following changes have been made:
- The Ubuntu image reference has been corrected to use a valid image ("Ubuntu2204").
- The deployment region has been updated from "WestUS2" to "centralindia" to help avoid quota issues experienced in the WestUS2 region.

## Create a Resource Group

In this section, we declare the environment variables and create a new resource group for our deployment. We append a random suffix to the resource group name to ensure uniqueness for each run.

```bash
export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export REGION="centralindia"
export MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="MyLinuxResourceGroup${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
az group create --name $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $REGION
```

Results: 

```JSON
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/resourceGroups/MyLinuxResourceGroupabc123",
  "location": "centralindia",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "MyLinuxResourceGroupabc123",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```

> The output above confirms that the resource group was created successfully in the centralindia region. Subscription identifiers and resource group names have been redacted for security.

## Create the Linux Virtual Machine

Next, we create a Linux virtual machine using the valid Ubuntu2204 image. We also generate SSH keys automatically with the --generate-ssh-keys flag if they do not already exist. A random suffix is added to the VM name to ensure uniqueness. Specifying the region as centralindia helps avoid potential core quota issues.

```bash
export ADMIN_USERNAME="azureuser"
export MY_VM_NAME="MyLinuxVM${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
az vm create --resource-group $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $MY_VM_NAME --image Ubuntu2204 --admin-username $ADMIN_USERNAME --generate-ssh-keys
```

Results:

```JSON
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/resourceGroups/MyLinuxResourceGroupabc123/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/MyLinuxVMabc123",
  "location": "centralindia",
  "name": "MyLinuxVMabc123",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "52.170.12.34"
}
```

> The output shows that the VM deployment was successful using the Ubuntu2204 image and provides details including the public IP address.

## Obtain the VM's Public IP

After the VM is deployed, we retrieve its public IP address. This IP address will be used to test the SSH connection.

```bash
export VM_PUBLIC_IP=$(az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $MY_VM_NAME --query "[].virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[].ipAddress" -o tsv)
echo "The VM public IP address is: $VM_PUBLIC_IP"
```

Results:

```text
The VM public IP address is: 52.170.12.34
```

> The command returns the public IP address of the virtual machine. Note that the actual IP address will vary with each deployment.

## Test SSH Connection to the VM

To ensure the VM is accessible via SSH without launching an interactive session, we run a non-interactive SSH command. This command executes a simple echo command on the VM and uses SSH options to disable strict host key checking and to operate in batch mode.

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $ADMIN_USERNAME@$VM_PUBLIC_IP echo "SSH connection successful"
```

Results:

```text
SSH connection successful
```

> The output confirms that the SSH connection to the VM is working as expected by printing the confirmation message.
